# BotGT
BotGT is a simple chat bot tool which you can use for websites online. You can check out the demo here: [https://chat-gt.replit.app/](https://chat-gt.replit.app/)https://chat-gt.replit.app/

How BotGT works is there is a json full of questions and answers for the chatbot to use. Depending on how close an input is to a question the bot will give an answer. If you want to train the database than create a new knowledge_base.json file and run the trainer.py script. The trainer.py script is like the online version but allows you to tell the ChatBot how to respond to questions. The main.py folder is python flask code for the online demo.
